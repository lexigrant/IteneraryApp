# IteneraryApp

## technologies used

The technologies used were first Javascript to write the code to be able to have the user see it on screen. The html was used for user interface of headers and data and css for prettiness of the app. I used mongoDB, mongoose, Heroku and express to set up my restful routes, deploy my data to the server and then also view on a website. I used ejs to be able to write JavaScript while being in html land as well.


## Approach taken

I first decided to make my schema with this i did an itenerary schema with a trip schema on that and then an activity schema on the trip schema. I then added on piece of data so that I could seed the data. After this I began to work on my seven restful routes with the itenerary. After successfully doing this I started to make routes for my sub-documents which was challenging. After finally tackling all routes I moved on to doing some CSS.

## unsolved problems

Many of my unsolved problems came with CSS and Bootstrap

## User Stories

As Lexi the traveler I want a place where I can plan multiple itineraries and be organized. Within the Itineraries I want to plan multiple trips and be able to add activities such as dinner for the night. I also want to be able to edit trips or activities in case someone cant make it or plans change.

## note to self

I'd like to update the css to make the browser look better

I also want multiple people to be able to view the same trip and make changes

having a login would be great with separate profiles
